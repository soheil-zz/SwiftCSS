# SwiftCSS

SwiftCSS extends UIView by providing CSS-like properties to position and size elements.
```
        let name = UILabel()
        name.text = "Look at me I'm some text"
        name.textAlignment = NSTextAlignment.Center
        name.marginTop = 20 // 20 pixels below the top of the page
        name.widthPercent = 80 // centers with a width of 80% of the page

        let addBtn = UIButton()
        name.marginTop = 20 // 20 pixels below the previous element
        addBtn.widthPercent = 100
        addBtn.height = 50 //pixels
        addBtn.marginBottomAbsolute = 0 //snaps to the bottom of the page
```
